<p>Invented by Nikola Tesla back in 1891, the Tesla coil can boost power from a wall socket or battery to millions of high frequency volts. In this booklet, the only systematic treatment of the Tesla coil for the electrical nonexpert, you'll find a wealth of information on one of the best-kept secrets of electric technology, plus all the facts you need to build a Tesla coil on any scale. And you can build one out of everyday stuff.

The coil shown features a beer-bottle capacitor. A well-tuned coil's output is harmless but can perform amazing tasks. Light your home, farm, or ranch at a fraction of the usual cost. Disinfect water. Build a powerful radio transmitter. Learn about the souped-up Tesla coil called the magnifying transmitter and how Tesla envisioned its use for wireless electric power and global communications.</p>
